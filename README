First, a least squares regression must be performed using experimental data to find a suitable mean value of alpha. This can be done by doing:
        python3 run_experiment.py <element symbol> <sensible guess for alpha> -1
Sensible values of alpha can be taken from either Hartmann or Vogel for the corresponding element.
This prints out an optimised value of alpha; make a note of this.

Next, the code needs to be run again, but with different input parameters:
        python3 run_experiment.py <element symbol> <fitted alpha from previous run> <number of samples>

A plot containing both the first order estimation and the brute force samples will be created, along with the mean and standard deviations of both distributions
